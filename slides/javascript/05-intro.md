** <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript> **

<br/>

JavaScript

<br/>

 * **weakly typed**
 * and has **first-class functions**.

.   <div class="handout">

 * An implementation of ECMAScript (ES + DOM + BOM)
 * Roots:
   * syntax -> from **C**
   * names and naming conventions -> from **Java**
   * key design principles -> from **Self** and **Scheme**
 * Cool, expressive language, but with some gotchas
 * Douglas "Good Parts" Crockford:
   * "Lisp in C's clothing"
   * "The most misunderstood programming language"

# Why JavaScript?

 * Runs in all browsers
 * Non-native Apps (smartphones, tablets)
