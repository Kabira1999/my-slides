# Fighting Pitfalls

 * use a **Lint** program (see later)
 * declare strict mode with ["use strict"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode)
 * learn JavaScript
   * scopes, functions, closures
   * operators, some patterns
   * learn how to avoid globals
 * invest in an excellent IDE (ideally from [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/))
 * comment your API with [JSDoc Toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/)
 * consider using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (compiles to JavaScript)
